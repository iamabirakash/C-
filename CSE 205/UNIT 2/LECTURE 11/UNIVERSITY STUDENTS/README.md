In a university, students are registering for different clubs based on their student ID numbers. Each club wants to separate students into two lists: one for students with even ID numbers and another for students with odd ID numbers. 



Your task is to write a program to help the clubs split the list of student IDs into two separate lists based on their parity (even or odd), using a grounded header linked list.
