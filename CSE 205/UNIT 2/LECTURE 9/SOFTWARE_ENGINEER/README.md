A software engineer is developing a function for a new feature in an editor application that rearranges numerical data. To test this, they need to create a singly linked list where each node contains an integer. 



The task is to swap every two adjacent nodes in the linked list and print the list before and after swapping.



Company Tags: Amazon, Microsoft, Moonfrog Labs

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the number of nodes in the linked list.

The second line consists of n integers, representing the data values for each node in the linked list.

Output format :
The first line of output prints the linked list before swapping.

The second line prints the linked list after swapping.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The given test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 30

0 ≤ data values ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
6
3 1 5 4 2 8
Output 1 :
Before swapping: 3 1 5 4 2 8 
After swapping: 1 3 4 5 8 2 
Input 2 :
5
1 2 3 4 5
Output 2 :
Before swapping: 1 2 3 4 5 
After swapping: 2 1 4 3
