Aaron is building a text editor feature to check if a user-entered word is a palindrome using a singly linked list. Each character of the word is stored as a node in the linked list. Write a program for him to construct the linked list from user input and determine if the word is a palindrome.

Input 1 :
`1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 $`

Output 1 :

The linked list is a palindrome

Input 2 :

`a b c d e f $`

Output 2 :

The linked list is not a palindrome

Input 3 :

`! @ # % ^ % # @ ! $`

Output 3 :

The linked list is a pal
