You are given a list of integers representing the scores of students in a class. The task is to sort the scores in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. 



Write a program that takes the list of scores as input and performs bubble sorting on the list. Finally, display the sorted list of scores.

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer n, representing the number of scores in the list.

The second line contains n space-separated integers, representing the scores of the students.

Output format :
The output prints the sorted array of scores, separated by a space.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ n ≤ 30

0 ≤ score ≤ 100 (the individual score of a student)

Sample test cases :

Input 1 :
5
89 72 95 68 82

Output 1 :
68 72 82 89 95 

Input 2 :
8
43 56 91 24 52 30 53 78

Output 2 :
24 30 43 52 53 56 78 9
