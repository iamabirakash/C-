Suppose you have been assigned the challenge of developing a queue data structure using a linked list. The program should allow users to interact with the queue by enqueuing positive integers and subsequently dequeuing and displaying elements.

Input format :
The input consists of a series of integers, one per line. Enter positive integers into the queue.

Enter -1 to terminate input.

Output format :
The output prints the space-separated dequeued elements.



Refer to the sample output for the exact text and format.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ elements ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1
2
3
4
-1
Output 1 :
Dequeued elements: 1 2 3 4 
Input 2 :
56
74
36
94
15
34
-1
Output 2 :
Dequeued elements: 56
