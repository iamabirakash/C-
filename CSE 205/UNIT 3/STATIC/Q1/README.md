Rithi is building a simple text editor that allows users to type characters, undo their typing, and view the current text. She has decided to implement this text editor using an array-based stack data structure.



She has to develop a basic text editor with the following features:

Type a Character (Push): Users can type a character and add it to the text editor.
Undo Typing (Pop): Users can undo their typing by removing the last character they entered from the editor.
View Current Text (Display): Users can view the current text in the editor, which is the sequence of characters in the buffer.
Exit: Users can exit the text editor application.


Write a program that simulates this text editor's undo feature using a character stack and implements the push, pop, and display operations accordingly.

Input format :
The input consists of integers corresponding to the operation that needs to be performed:

Choice 1: Push the character onto the stack. If the choice is 1, the following input is a character, representing the character to be pushed onto the stack in the next line.

Choice 2: Pop the character from the stack.

Choice 3: Display the characters in the stack.

Choice 4: Exit the program.

Output format :
The output displays messages according to the choice and the status of the stack:

If the choice is 1, push the given character to the stack and display the character.
If the choice is 2, undo the character from the stack and display the character that is removed.
If the choice is 2, and if the stack is empty without any characters, print "Text editor buffer is empty. Nothing to undo."
If the choice is 3, print the characters in the stack.
If the choice is 3, and there are no characters in the stack, print "Text editor buffer is empty."
If the choice is 4, exit the program.
If any other choice is entered, print "Invalid choice"


Refer to the sample output for the exact format.

Code constraints :
The maximum size of the stack is defined as 100.

Choice: 1, 2, 3, or 4

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :

Current text: E H 
Undo: Removed character E
Current text: H 
Input 3 :

Output 3 :
Text editor buffer is empty.
