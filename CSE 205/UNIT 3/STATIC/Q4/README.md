Aaron is learning data structures, and his teacher gave him a task related to the queue data structure. The queue should be implemented as a linked list, where each node holds a customer's ID.



He is required to implement a simple program that supports the following operations:

Enqueue: Add a customer's ID to the end of the queue.
Dequeue: Remove and return the customer's ID from the front of the queue.
Display: Display the current customer IDs in the queue.


Your task is to help Aaron implement the operations mentioned above.

Input format :
The input consists of integers corresponding to the operation that needs to be performed:

Choice 1: Enqueue the customer ID into the queue. If the choice is 1, the following input is a space-separated integer, representing the customers' ID to be enqueued into the queue.

Choice 2: Dequeue a customer ID from the queue.

Choice 3: Display the customer IDs in the queue.

Choice 4: Exit the queue

Output format :
The output displays messages according to the choice and the status of the queue:



If the choice is 1:

Insert the given customer ID into the queue and display "Customer ID X is enqueued" where X is the customer ID that is inserted.
If the choice is 2:

Dequeue a customer ID from the queue and display "Dequeued customer ID: " followed by the corresponding ID that is dequeued.
If the queue is empty without any elements, print "Queue is empty".
If the choice is 3:

The output prints "Customer IDs in the queue are: " followed by the space-separated customer IDs present in the queue.
If there are no elements in the queue, print "Queue is empty".
If the choice is 4:

Exit the program.
If any other choice is entered, print "Invalid option".



Refer to the sample output for the exact text and format.

Code constraints :
Choice: 1, 2, or 3.
