Design a system for an emergency room where patients arrive with varying medical conditions, each assigned a severity score. Create a priority queue to manage patient treatment based on severity, ensuring those with higher scores are treated first. 



Patients are dequeued in order of severity for treatment.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the number of patients in the emergency room.

The next N lines consist of two space-separated values each:

A string representing the patient's name.
An integer value representing the severity score.
Output format :
For each patient being treated, the output displays a line: "Treating patient: X (Severity: Y)" where X is the patient's name and Y is the severity score.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 20

1 ≤ severity score ≤ 20

Patient names are strings with a maximum length of 50 characters.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
6
Frank 8
Grace 1
Hank 4
Ivy 2
Jack 6
Karen 5
Output 1 :
Treating patient: Frank (Severity: 8)
Treating patient: Jack (Severity: 6)
Treating patient: Karen (Severity: 5)
Treating patient: Hank (Severity: 4)
Treating patient: Ivy (Severity: 2)
Treating patient: Grace (Severity: 1)
Input 2 :
5
Alice 4
Bob 6
Carol 3
David 7
Eve 5
Output 2 :
Treating patient: David (Severity: 7)
Treating patient: Bob (Severity: 6)
Treating patient: Eve (Severity: 5)
Treating patient: Alice (Severity: 4)
Treating patient: Carol (Severity: 3)
Input 3 :
7
Liam 7
Mia 5
Noah 6
Olivia 3
Penelope 8
Quinn 2
Riley 4
Output 3 :
Treating patient: Penelope (Severity: 8)
Treating patient: Liam (Severity: 7)
Treating patient: Noah (Severity: 6)
Treating patient: Mia (Severity: 5)
Treating patient: Riley (Severity: 4)
Treating patient: Olivia (Severity: 3)
Treating patient: Quinn
