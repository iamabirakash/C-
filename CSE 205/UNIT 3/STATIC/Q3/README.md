In a bustling IT department, staff regularly submit helpdesk tickets to request technical assistance. Managing these tickets efficiently is vital for providing quality support.



Your task is to develop a program that uses an array-based queue to handle and prioritize helpdesk tickets based on their unique IDs.



Implement a program that provides the following functionalities:

Enqueue Helpdesk Ticket: Add a new helpdesk ticket to the end of the queue. Provide a positive integer representing the ticket ID for the new ticket.
Dequeue Helpdesk Ticket: Remove and process the next helpdesk ticket from the front of the queue. The program will display the ticket ID of the processed ticket.
Display Queue: Display the ticket IDs of all the helpdesk tickets currently in the queue.
Input format :
The input consists of integers corresponding to the operation that needs to be performed:

Choice 1: Enqueue the ticket ID into the queue. If the choice is 1, the following input is a space-separated integer, representing the ticket ID to be enqueued into the queue.

Choice 2: Dequeue a ticket from the queue.

Choice 3: Display the ticket IDs in the queue.

Choice 4: Exit the program.

Output format :
The output displays messages according to the choice and the status of the queue:



If the choice is 1:

Insert the given ticket ID into the queue and display "Helpdesk Ticket ID [id] is enqueued." where [id] is the ticket ID that is inserted.
If the queue is full, print "Queue is full. Cannot enqueue."
If the choice is 2:

Dequeue a ticket ID from the queue and display "Dequeued Helpdesk Ticket ID: " followed by the corresponding ID that is dequeued.
If the queue is empty without any elements, print "Queue is empty."
If the choice is 3:

The output prints "Helpdesk Ticket IDs in the queue are: " followed by the space-separated ticket IDs present in the queue.
If there are no elements in the queue, print "Queue is empty."
If the choice is 4:

Exit the program and print "Exiting the program"
If any other choice is entered, print "Invalid option."



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
Maximum number of helpdesk tickets stored in the queue is 5.

Choice: 1, 2, 3, or 4

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1 101
1 202
1 203
1 204
