John is managing a list of tasks using a stack implemented as a linked list. He wants to remove all tasks with even numbers and keep only the tasks with odd numbers in the stack. 



Your task is to write a program to help him accomplish this.

Input format :
The input consists of an integer n, the number of tasks, followed by n integers representing the tasks.

Output format :
The first line of output prints the tasks in the stack after inserting all tasks.

The second line prints the remaining tasks after removing the even-numbered tasks.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 15

1 ≤ elements ≤ 100
