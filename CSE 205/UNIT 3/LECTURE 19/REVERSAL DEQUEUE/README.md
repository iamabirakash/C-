You are working on a program that manages a deque. The deque initially contains a set of integer elements. 



Write a program to implement the reversal operation on the deque. Your program should prompt the user to enter the elements of the deque and then output the reversed elements.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of the number of elements N in the deque.

The second line consists of the N deque elements, separated by space.

Output format :
The output displays the reversed deque elements, separated by space.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ N ≤ 100

-100 ≤ deque elements ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
12 59 -91 62 48
Output 1 :
48 62 -91 59 12 
Input 2 :
10
7 8 5 3 6 2 5 9 4 1
Output 2 :
1 4 9 5 2 6 3 5 8 7
