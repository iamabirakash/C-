Tisha wants to write a program that welcomes a person and says hello to them. 



Program Approach



The user must enter the name of the person. 
It should then create objects of the classes Welcome and Hello, which have default constructors to print "Welcome" and "Hello" respectively. 
Finally, the program should display the person's name after each greeting.
