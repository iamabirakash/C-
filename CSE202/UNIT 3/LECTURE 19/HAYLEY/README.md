Hayley has to write a program that takes an array of up to 100 integers as input. Store them in a file named 'reverse.txt' after reversing the elements of the array. After that, the code has to read the contents of the file and print the same. Help her with the code as she is unable to finish it.



Note: Use a structure to implement this program.

Input format :
The first line consists of an integer representing the size of the array.

The second line consists of space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

Output format :
If size > 100; the output displays "Exceeding limit!" and terminates.

Otherwise, the output displays the entered array elements in a reverse manner separated by a space.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 <= size <= 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
7
-8 95 0 2 33 45 4
Output 1 :
4 45 33 2 0 95 -8 
Input 2 :
101

Output 2 :
Exceeding limit!
