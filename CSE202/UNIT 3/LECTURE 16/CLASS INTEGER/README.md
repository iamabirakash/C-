You need to implement a program that uses a class Inte﻿ger to manage integer values. The class should utilize an initializer list to set the integer value, and in the main function, an array of Integer objects is created based on user input. For every even index, assign a value of 10, and display all values in the array.

Input format :
The input consists of an integer, N.

Output format :
The output prints the values of the Integer objects separated by a new line.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
