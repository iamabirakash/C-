Create a program to manage book sales data, including the units sold, total revenue, and average price. Implement a class named SalesData with the following features:



Parameterized constructor: Accepts total revenue (double) and units sold (integer) as arguments.



displayData function: Displays units sold, total revenue, and average price (calculated as total revenue divided by units sold).



Your task is to implement the SalesData class and display a book's sales data using an instance of the class.

Input format :
The input consists of the following in separate lines:

Total revenue generated (a double value)
Number of units sold (an integer)
Output format :
The program displays the following in separate lines:

Units sold (an integer)
Total revenue rounded to two decimal places (a double value)
Average price rounded to two decimal places (a double value)


Refer to the sample output for the exact format.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1.0 ≤ price ≤ 1000.0

1 ≤ number of units ≤ 200

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1890.23 
500
Output 1 :
Units Sold: 500
Revenue Generated: 1890.23
Average Price: 3.78
Input 2 :
25.0
25
Output 2 :
Units Sold: 25
Revenue Generated: 25.00
Average Price: 1.00
