Misha needs a program to open and close files based on user input. The program should ask for the file name, and display messages for successful file opening and closing.

Input format :
The input consists of the name of the file they want to open and close and the filename as a single line of text.

Output format :
If the file is successfully opened, it displays "File 'filename' opened successfully.".

Regardless of whether the file was opened successfully or not, it displays "File 'filename' closed successfully." to indicate that the file is closed at the end of the program.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
4<=File Name<=100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
sample.txt
Output 1 :
File 'sample.txt' opened successfully.
File 'sample.txt' closed successfully.
Input 2 :
input.txt
Output 2 :
File 'input.txt' opened successfully.
File 'input.txt' closed
