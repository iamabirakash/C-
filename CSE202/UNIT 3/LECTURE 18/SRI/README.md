Sri wants to write a program that calculates the sum of two numbers and stores the result in a file named "sum.txt". Sri needs to implement the program using file stream operations. If there is an error opening the file, the program displays an error message on the console.



Note: Sri should ensure that the program has write permissions for the directory where it is executed to create and write to the "sum.txt" file.

Input format :
The input consists of two space-separated integers n1 and n2, representing the values.

Output format :
The first line displays the indicate the message "Sum successfully written to the file 'sum.txt'."

The second line displays the sum of the given two input values.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n1, n2 ≤ 50000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
3 5
Output 1 :
Sum successfully written to the file 'sum.txt'.
Sum: 8
Input 2 :
100 23
Output 2 :
Sum successfully written to the file 'sum.txt'.
Sum: 123
