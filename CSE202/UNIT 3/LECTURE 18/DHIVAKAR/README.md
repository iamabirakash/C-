Dhivakar is working on a program that involves processing numerical data. He needs to write a program that allows the user to input a set of numbers, stores them in an array, and then write the numbers to a file named "sample.dat". Additionally, the program should find the maximum and minimum values from the input numbers and display them on the console.

Input format :
The first line of the input consists of an integer N, representing the number of values to be entered.

The second line of input consists of N space-separated values.

Output format :
The output prints two space-separated integers representing the maximum and minimum values, respectively.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
2 ≤ N ≤ 100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
3 5 2 4 1
Output 1 :
5 1
Input 2 :
3
67 54 3
Output 2 :
67 3
