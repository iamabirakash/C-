Preethi runs a small shop and wants to calculate the total cost of items based on their quantity. Write a program that helps Preethi by implementing a class Item with inline methods to set item details (number and cost) and to calculate the total cost. The program should read item details and quantity from the user, and then display the total cost.



Note: This is a sample question asked in a Capgemini interview.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer representing the item number.

The second line of input consists of a floating-point number representing the cost of the item.

The last line consists of an integer representing the quantity of the item purchased.

Output format :
A single-line output displaying the total cost of the item as a float value, rounded to two decimal places.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ item number ≤ 1000

1.0 ≤ cost of the item ≤ 1000.0

1 ≤ quantity ≤ 50

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
123
4.99
3
Output 1 :
Total cost: 14.97

Input 2 :
456
2.49
10
Output 2 :
Total cost: 24.90
