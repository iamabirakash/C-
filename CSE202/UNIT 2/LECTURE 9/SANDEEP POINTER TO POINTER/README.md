Sandeep is developing a language processing tool for a linguistics research project. The goal is to analyze the consonant usage in a given text. Write a program that takes a paragraph as input and counts the number of consonants in each word of the text. Utilize the pointer-to-pointer concept to analyze the query and count the consonants.

Input format :
The input consists of a list of words/sentences.

Output format :
The output prints the count of the consonants that are present in the given sentence/sentences.



﻿Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ Total number of characters in the sentence(s) ≤ 1000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
I love eating pizza and drinking soda on weekends
Output 1 :
24
Input 2 :
hello world
Output 2 :
