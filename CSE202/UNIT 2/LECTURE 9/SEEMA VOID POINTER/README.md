Seema is learning about void pointers and their applications. Help her to write a program that takes an integer and a character. The program should check the following:



If the integer is positive, negative, or zero.
If the character is an alphabet, number, or not.


Display appropriate messages for everything.



Note: This is a sample question asked in an IBM interview.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer, n.

The second line of input consists of a character, c.

Output format :
The first line of output consists of one of the following:

If the integer is a positive integer, the output prints "The number is positive".
If the integer is a negative integer, the output prints "The number is negative".
If the integer is zero, the output prints "The number is zero".


The second line of output consists of one of the following.

If the character is an alphabet, the output prints "The character is an alphabet".
If the character is a number, the output prints "The character is a number".
If the character is neither an alphabet nor a number, the output prints "The character is not a number or an alphabet".


Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

-109 < n < 109

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
22
C
Output 1 :
The number is positive
The character is an alphabet
Input 2 :
-5
2
Output 2 :
The number is negative
The character is a number
Input 3 :
0
@
Output 3 :
The number is zero
The character is not a
