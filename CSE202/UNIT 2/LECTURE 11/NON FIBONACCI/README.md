Peter is developing a program to filter out non-Fibonacci numbers from a list of integers. He has created a class named NonFibonacciElements to achieve this task. Given an array of integers, write a program inside this class to identify and print all elements that are not Fibonacci numbers.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the number of elements in the array.

The second line consists of N space-separated integers, representing the array elements.

Output format :
The output prints all elements from the input array that are not Fibonacci numbers, separated by a space.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ N ≤ 10

1 ≤ array elements ≤ 1000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
7
1 5 3 8 9 13 4
Output 1 :
9 4 
Input 2 :
8
53 68 94 91 95 2 97 82
Output 2 :
53 68 94 91 95 97 82
