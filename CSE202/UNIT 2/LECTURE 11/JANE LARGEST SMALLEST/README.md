Jane has a collection of numbers and wants to determine the largest and smallest elements within it. Write a program that reads the size of her collection and the elements, then finds and prints the largest and smallest elements.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, representing the number of elements in the collection.

The second line consists of n space-separated integers, representing the elements in Jane's collection.

Output format :
The first line of output prints "The largest element is: " followed by the largest element in the collection.

The second line prints "The smallest element is: " followed by the smallest element in the collection.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 10

1 ≤ elements in collection ≤ 1000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
89 68 57 54 25
Output 1 :
The largest element is: 89
The smallest element is: 25
Input 2 :
10
78 96 75 63 62 45 52 21 23 28 
Output 2 :
The largest element is: 96
The smallest element i
