Imagine you have two objects: obj1 and obj2, each with a numerical value. You want to create a simple program that allows you to compare these values and determine whether they are equal or not while using the "this" pointer concept.

Input format :
The input consists of two integer values for obj1 and obj2, separated by a space.

Output format :
After comparing the values of obj1 and obj2, the program should display one of the following messages:

"The values are equal" if the values are equal.
"The values are not equal" if the values are not equal.


Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

-105 ≤ obj1, obj2 ≤ 105

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
10 20
Output 1 :
The values are not equal
Input 2 :
30 30
Output 2 :
The values are equal
Input 3 :
-20 -20
Output 3 :
The values are equal
