Emma is organizing an array of characters for a coding competition. She needs to reverse the order of the characters in the array to meet the competition's requirements. 



Assist her in writing a program that takes the size and the characters as input, reverses the array and prints the updated one.

Input format :

The first line of input consists of an integer n, that represents the size of the array.

The second line consists of n characters in the array, separated by spaces.

Output format :

The output prints a single line displaying the updated array after the characters are reversed.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 20

The input characters can be any printable ASCII characters.
